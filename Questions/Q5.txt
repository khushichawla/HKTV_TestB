Due to time constraints and the advanced knowledge and experience required, it was not feasible to implement the microservice for data
migration and API development. Instead, I am providing a detailed approach outlining the necessary steps and considerations for the 
implementation. The following is a step by step approach on creating the microservice with documentation and user guide in the Kubernetes
environment for data migration from CSV to MySQL (MariaDB). In addition, the process of preparing indexing in the database after the
migration along with the below API endpoint.

1. Design the Microservice Architecture:
- Determine the overall architecture of the microservice, considering factors such as scalability, fault tolerance, and performance.
- Decide on the appropriate components, such as controllers, services, repositories, and models, based on the Spring Boot framework.

2. Set Up the Kubernetes Environment:
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster or use an existing one to deploy and manage your microservice.
- Configure necessary resources, such as pods, deployment, services, and ingress, to ensure proper deployment and accessibility.

3. Prepare the Data Migration Process:
- Write logic to read the CSV data and transform it into a format compatible with the database schema.
- Establish a database connection to MariaDB and create tables based on the desired 3NF (Third Normal Form) schema.
- Write code to insert the transformed data into the MariaDB database using appropriate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) techniques.

4. Implement Indexing in the Database:
- Identify the fields that require indexing based on the expected search patterns.
- Utilize the indexing capabilities provided by MariaDB to enhance search performance.
- Create indexes on the relevant columns of the database tables.

5. Write API Endpoint for Date-based Search:
- Create a new endpoint in the microservice to handle the date-based search against the DATE_OCC field.
- Design the endpoint as a POST request with a specified path.
- Define the request body format, including the from_date and to_date fields.
- Implement the logic to query the database based on the provided date range and retrieve the relevant data.
- Structure the response to match the specified format, including the required fields and their corresponding data types.

6. Generate API Documentation and User Guide:
- Utilize tools like Swagger or Springfox to generate API documentation automatically based on the implemented endpoints.
- Document the purpose, input format, response format, and any additional details for each API endpoint.
- Create a user guide that explains how to interact with the microservice, including authentication (if required), endpoint usage, and response interpretation.

7. Considerations for Large Data File:
- Evaluate the size of the main data file and assess the approach for feeding the data to the microservice.
- Consider strategies such as batching or streaming to handle large data files efficiently.
- Implement appropriate mechanisms to handle errors, retries, and ensure data integrity during the migration process.

8. Test and Deploy the Microservice:
- Write unit tests to validate the functionality of the microservice, including the data migration, indexing, and API endpoints.
- Deploy the microservice in your Kubernetes environment, ensuring all necessary configurations and dependencies are in place.
- Monitor the microservice's performance and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
- Conduct thorough testing to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data migration process and API functionality.
